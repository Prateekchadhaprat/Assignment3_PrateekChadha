# Assignment3_PrateekChadha
The objective of this assignment is to design and implement a Vehicle Rental 
Management System using object-oriented principles. You will practice inheritance, 
abstraction, and encapsulation while developing classes to represent vehicles and a 
rental agency.
. Inheritance:
• Utilized inheritance to create a hierarchy of classes where Car, Truck, and 
Motorcycle inherit common properties and methods from the Vehicle class.
• Ensure that subclasses inherit properties and methods that are common to 
all vehicles while being able to extend functionality with specific properties 
and methods.
2. Abstraction:
• Used abstraction by defining a method DisplayDetails() in the Vehicle class 
and override it in subclasses (Car, Truck, Motorcycle) to display specific 
details unique to each vehicle type while maintaining the same method 
signature.
• Encapsulate class properties and methods appropriately to hide internal 
implementation details and expose only necessary functionality.
3. Encapsulation:
• Implemented proper encapsulation by making class properties private and 
providing public methods to access and modify them.
• Ensure that class methods perform necessary validations and operations to 
maintain the integrity of the data.
